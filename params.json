Discovering Python\r\n\r\n### Course 2 - Setting things up\r\n\r\n* Using the online interpreter\r\n* Installing Python\r\n* Writing our first programs\r\n\r\n### Course 3 - Discovering Python\r\n\r\n* Language features\r\n\t* Variables\r\n    * Types\r\n    * Operations\r\n    * Calling functions and manipulating data\r\n    * Branching and loops\r\n    * Variable scopes\r\n\r\n### Course 4 - Going further\r\n\r\n* Defining function and calling them\r\n* Containers and data structures\r\n* Printing anything\r\n* Interactive programming\r\n    * Reading user input\r\n    * Reading / writing files\r\n    * Command line options\r\n\r\nAt the end of this course, you should know enough Python to create simple programs\r\nthat can manipulate data in a command line environment.\r\n\r\n## Blue Program - Intermediate\r\n\r\nThis program requires a little knowledge of the Python language, and focuses on\r\ncreating better structured programs that leverage the power of object oriented\r\nprogramming.\r\n\r\n### Course 1 - Object Oriented Programming\r\n\r\n* Introduction to object-oriented thinking\r\n* Designing and creating objects\r\n* Methods and attributes\r\n* Inheritance\r\n\r\n### Course 2 - Going further into the language\r\n\r\n* Splitting arguments: arg and kwargs\r\n* Static & class methods\r\n* Accessors\r\n* Docstrings\r\n* List comprehensions\r\n* Iterators and generators\r\n\r\n### Course 3 - Structuring Python\r\n\r\n* Splitting code into multiple files\r\n* Creating modules and packages\r\n* Working with others: importing external code with pip\r\n\r\n## Red Program - Advanced\r\n\r\nThis program requires good skills in software development, a solid knowledge of\r\nthe Python language and focuses on how to use it in a professional environment,\r\ninteracting with other developer and their code, testing and packaging.\r\n\r\n### Course 1 - Setting up a professional development environment\r\n\r\n* Installing an IDE\r\n* Introduction to debugging\r\n* Projects and virtual environments\r\n* Testing your code\r\n* Dependency management - Mastering pip\r\n\r\n### Course 2 - Asynchronous programming\r\n\r\n* Introduction to asynchronous thinking\r\n* Parallel working\r\n* Example with web servers\r\n\r\n### Course 3 - Leaving the CLI - Programs with GUI\r\n\r\n* Native UIs with PyQt\r\n* Plotting scientific data with matplotlib\r\n* Crafting 3D games with OpenGL\r\n\r\n## Black Program - Expert\r\n\r\nProgram coming soon...\r\n",
